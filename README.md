# Retailer app using Ionic WIP.

This project mainly for learning how to use [XState](https://xstate.js.org) to implement Pure UI.

# Requirements
- Backend [Strapi-Store](https://github.com/Sh4reef/strapi-store)

## Todo

## XState machines samples within the app

- Fetch machines

```
Related sample using [Statecharts](https://xstate.js.org/viz/)

```
